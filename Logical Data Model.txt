A logical data model describes the data in as much detail as possible, without regard to how they will be physical implemented in the database. Features of a logical data model include:

Includes all entities and relationships among them.
All attributes for each entity are specified.
The primary key for each entity is specified.
Foreign keys (keys identifying the relationship between different entities) are specified.
Normalization occurs at this level.
The steps for designing the logical data model are as follows:

1.Specify primary keys for all entities.
2.Find the relationships between different entities.
3.Find all attributes for each entity.
4.Resolve many-to-many relationships.
5.Normalization.
