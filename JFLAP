JFLAP
JFLAP is software for experimenting with formal languages topics including nondeterministic finite automata,
nondeterministic pushdown automata, multi-tape Turing machines, several types of grammars, parsing, and L-systems. 
In addition to constructing and testing examples for these, JFLAP allows one to experiment with construction proofs 
from one form to another, such as converting an NFA to a DFA to a minimal state DFA to a regular expression or 
regular grammar.
