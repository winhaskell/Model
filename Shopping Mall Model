Shopping Mall Model aims to demonstrate design, accesses, layout, location, landscape and other aspects of a shopping mall.

The mall, usually being a part of a complex of offices and residential apartments, is the center of the whole piece of land.

To better serve developersâ€™ needs of illustration, the shopping mall model provides a clear picture showing different areas
with corresponding functions, such as shopping, food, entertainment and parking.
