Conceptual, Logical and Physical Data Model
Conceptual, logical and physical model or ERD are three different ways of modeling data in a domain.
While they all contain entities and relationships, they differ in the purposes they are created for 
and audiences they are meant to target. A general understanding to the three models is that, business 
analyst uses conceptual and logical model for modeling the data required and produced by system from
a business angle, while database designer refines the early design to produce the physical model for
presenting physical database structure ready for database construction.
