Uppaal is an integrated tool environment for modeling, validation and verification of real-time systems modeled 
as networks of timed automata, extended with data types (bounded integers, arrays, etc.).

The tool is developed in collaboration between the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University, Sweden 
and the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University in Denmark.
