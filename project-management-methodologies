Understanding project management
Project management plays a crucial role in accomplishing goals and following through with plans and expectations. 
Often times, businesses have huge hopes for projects and for team members to collaborate on their ideas but things 
donâ€™t get carried out as planned.

Project management methodology helps managers through every stage of a project. It begins with helping the manager 
plan, initiate, and implement the project. Methodologies even take the project to closure. They are models that project 
managers can use to plan and achieve task goals.

Different projects benefit from different methodologies. Not every style of project management will work for every 
assignment. In order to recognize which method will work best for your project, you need to be familiar with these 
common project methodologies and their differences.
