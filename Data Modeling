Data Modeling Made Simple with PowerDesigner will provide the business or IT professional with a practical
working knowledge of data modeling concepts and best practices, and how to apply these principles with PowerDesigner.
You'll build many PowerDesigner data models along the way, increasing your skills in first the fundamentals and later
in the book the more advanced features of PowerDesigner. This book combines real-world experience and best practices
to help you master the following ten objectives:

You will know when a data model is needed and which PowerDesigner models are the most appropriate for each situation

You will be able to read a data model of any size and complexity with the same confidence as reading a book

You will know when to apply and how to make use of all the key features of PowerDesigner

You will be able to build, step-by-step in PowerDesigner, a pyramid of linked data models, including a conceptual data model, 
a fully normalized relational data model, a physical data model, and an easily navigable dimensional model

You will be able to apply techniques such as indexing, transforms, and forward engineering to turn a logical data model 
into an efficient physical design

You will improve data governance and modeling consistency within your organization by leveraging features such as 
PowerDesigner's reference models, Glossary, domains, and model comparison and model mapping techniques

You will be able to use PowerDesigner to make your data model(s) the center of all your data management 
initiatives: MDM, Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence, ERP, Data Governance, SOA/XML, Agile development

You will know how to integrate your PowerDesigner models with externally-managed files, including the import 
and export of data using Excel and Requirements documents

You will know where you can take advantage of the entire PowerDesigner model set, to increase the success rate 
of corporate-wide initiatives such as business intelligence and enterprise resource planning (ERP)

You will understand the key differentiators between PowerDesigner and other data modeling tools you may have used before





This book contains six sections:
Section I introduces data modeling along with its purpose and variations. 
Also included is an explanation of the important role of a data modeling tool, 
the key features required of any data modeling tool, and an introduction to the essential features of PowerDesigner.

Section II explains all of the components on a data model including entities, data elements,
relationships, and keys, and describes how to create and manage these objects in PowerDesigner.
Also included is a discussion of the importance of quality names and definitions for your objects.

Section III dives into the relational and dimensional subject area, logical, and physical 
data models, and describes how PowerDesigner supports these models and the connections between them.
Learn how to get information into and out of PowerDesigner, and improve the quality of your data models 
with a cross-reference of key PowerDesigner features with the Data Model ScorecardÂ®.

Section IV contains a PowerDesigner workshop designed to consolidate everything for you.

Section V focuses on additional PowerDesigner features (some of which have already been introduced) 
which make life easier for data modelers.

Section VI discusses PowerDesigner topics beyond data modeling, including the XML physical model and 
the other types of model available in PowerDesigner; it also discusses the role of PowerDesigner in data management, 
using the DAMA Data Management Body of Knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK) framework.
