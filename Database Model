A database model shows the logical structure of a database, including the relationships and constraints that determine
how data can be stored and accessed. Individual database models are designed based on the rules and concepts of whichever 
broader data model the designers adopt. Most data models can be represented by an accompanying database diagram.


Types of database models
There are many kinds of data models. Some of the most common ones include:

Hierarchical database model
Relational model
Network model
Object-oriented database model
Entity-relationship model
Document model
Entity-attribute-value model
Star schema
The object-relational model, which combines the two that make up its name
You may choose to describe a database with any one of these depending on several factors. 

The biggest factor is whether the database management system you are using supports a particular model. 
Most database management systems are built with a particular data model in mind and require their users to adopt that model, 
although some do support multiple models.

In addition, different models apply to different stages of the database design process. High-level conceptual data models 
are best for mapping out relationships between data in ways that people perceive that data. Record-based logical models, 
on the other hand, more closely reflect ways that the data is stored on the server.

Selecting a data model is also a matter of aligning your priorities for the database with the strengths of a particular 
model, whether those priorities include speed, cost reduction, usability, or something else.
